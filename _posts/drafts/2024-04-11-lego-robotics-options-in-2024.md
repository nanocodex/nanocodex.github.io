I've been a robotics fan for a long time. Whether it would be [Arcbotics' Sparki](https://arcbotics.com/products/sparki) or [Makeblock's Halocode](https://education.makeblock.com/product/halocode-v2/), I would always be interested in trying to program it to do something interesting. But until last year, I never noticed how prominent this interest of mine was, as I was instead obsessed over Lego Technic. When I saw the price of official lego electronics however, I decided to turn to non-Lego robotics projects instead.

# Why choose Lego to make robots?

Excellent question. While I was aware of the cut-throat prices programmable Lego electronics cost nowadays, I was not dissuaded as I simply could not resist the temptation of being able to take what is essentially a childhood toy, and use Technic parts to construct robots in any shape I wanted, to serve any function I needed. It sounded like the _perfect_ solution to counter the steep learning curve of learning 3D-modelling, circuit designing, and all the other skillsets needed to create a non-Lego robot in my eyes. And it did!

But at what cost, you might ask? **Exactly.** The cost. When I had plans to make my own RC car out of Lego Technic parts, I could not escape the sky-high prices of programmable Lego electronics, such as motors, sensors, and the programmable Hub connecting all of them together.

That being said, Lego is still more versatile than 3D-printing when it comes to designing the exterior and skeleton of the robot you want to make, with less skill required. Mechanisms and aesthetics are more viable to rebuild, and swapping out official lego electronics with non-lego alternatives can significantly reduce the cost of the Bill of Materials. So if you have plans on creating a robot without wanting to get into the intricacies of regular robot building, this article is right for you.

# Raspberry Pi Build HAT

<!-- For me at least, I feel like the Raspberry Pi is too high-end for my interest in technology. While microcontrollers like Arduino are great at controlling robots of all sorts, something doesn't sit right with me watching what is essentially a computer only being used to spin a few motors and read a few sensors. And while I do have a Raspberry Pi Model 3B+ at home (I even configured it to use VNC server to display on my iPad), I hardly do anything with it at time of writing because most projects I have in mind can be easily accomplised using an Arduino, with shields of all sorts to fit the job too. -->

The build HAT is a type of hat, an extension board for the Raspberry Pi that mounts using the GPIO headers.
