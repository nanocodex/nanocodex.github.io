Hey there! This is my first post here, so you may be wondering what to expect from my blog. Fret not! Because I'm here to give you some insight into exactly that. I'll be posting about my interests and hobbies primarily, which include:

* Robotics
* Technical Minecraft
* Lego Technic
* Team Fortress 2
* Programming
* Nonexistent Chinese Characters

As you can tell, I love tinkering and problem-solving. Troubleshooting can be annoying but I personally find it ever so satisfying whenever I get down to the root of the problem. Anyways, that's all I have for now. Until the next post, see you!
